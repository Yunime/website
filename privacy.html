            This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of Your information when You use the Service and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You.

        Physically we can't. We don't have a place to store it. We don't even have a server database to store it. So even if Justin Bieber kindly asked to see your data, we would have nothing to show him. That's why, with Yunime, what happens on your computer stays on your computer.
